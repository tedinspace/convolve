# www.tedsite.com/convolve

numerically compute convolution integrals given a specified interval, f(x), and g(x)

## TODO

### Major

- which to katex

- dark mode graphs

- implement layout of plots (and make sure plotly behaves on resizing)

- examples section (with latex and a loading button)

- functions section/table 

- set up github pages (installation, fix package.json, test it out)

### Convolution work space

- slider for setting value of tau 

- animate g(x-tau) on slider with dashed lines

- have f(x) stationary but in dashed lines

- draw convolution as it progresses (dashed and solid? or just solid as it comes )

### Minor Aesthetic/Usability 

- add a warning about the true ranges of functions when user inputs out of range

- consider hiding steps

- color choosing: be able to select color of function
